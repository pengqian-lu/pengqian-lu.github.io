### About Me

Aloha! I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Technology Sydney (UTS)](https://www.uts.edu.au/), under the supervision of Prof. [Jie Lu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Jie.Lu). I am conducting my research at the [Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute), a world-leading research institute in artificial intelligence.

Previously, I obtained my Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) degree from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), where I was supervised by Dr. [Tongliang Liu](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/tongliang-liu.html).

My primary research interests include:
*   Learning with Concept Drift
*   LLM Hallucination Detection
*   Learning with Label Noise

Outside of academia, I enjoy reading historical books, solving challenges, and chatting with interesting people.
